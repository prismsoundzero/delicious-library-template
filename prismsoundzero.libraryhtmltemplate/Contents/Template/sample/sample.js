After years of pursuing a lightly different path with his band Angels Of Light and recording and producing a diverse roster of artists for his Young God label, Michael Gira has reconvened his legendary group Swans. As he says: ''This is not a reunion. It's not some dumb-ass nostalgia act. It is not repeating the past. After five Angels Of Light albums, I need a way to move forward, in a new direction, and it just so happens that revivifying the idea of Swans allows me to do that.''"},{"id":"293CA1DB-2757-4433-9B30-21BBA2CA2EFD","title":"An Ideal for Living","artist":"Joy Division","description":""},{"id":"D82CC77F-2003-4E85-8303-9DFD7261FFE9","title":"Silence Yourself","artist":"Savages","description":""},{"id":"0938A774-7A2D-48B6-9B02-D0191C868B55","title":"Pretty hate machine","artist":"Nine Inch Nails","description":""},{"id":"6EC5327C-798F-4D2C-8B00-1FAEF993DD10","title":"Wakin on a Pretty","artist":"Kurt Vile","description":"2LP 2Lp Gatefold Edition W/Download Code"},{"id":"889AD4AC-44B4-420D-AFBC-20AD9A0C13C4","title":"Opiate","artist":"Tool","description":""},{"id":"E8C16D0A-818F-4877-845B-1B7CC200E50F","title":"Jazz Way Out","artist":"John Coltrane","description":""},{"id":"5EDFF6F7-CEF2-4EBE-AC32-5E636F335E0C","title":"Midnight Sun","artist":"The GOASTT","description":"The Goastt is two people, Sean Lennon and Charlotte Kemp Muhl. It is, in itself, a chimera; a fabulous creature made with parts of two distinctly different creatures. It is also an acronym for The Ghost Of A Saber Tooth Tiger. 2014 sees the duo's release of Midnight Sun, a guided tour of bold, shape-shifting sonic murals and evocative lyrical panoramas. Plucking musical ingredients from all over the map, the album has a highly imaginative and distinct feel. It celebrates the unusual and the grandiose but fundamentally just rocks hard and feels good.<br /><br />With an infectious sense of adventure akin to Beck and Flaming Lips, and several years of touring and recording under their belt, the Goastt takes their creative and savvy approach to psychedelia to new extremes. The ambitious songs flow cleverly together with unexpected ease to tell a vivid and provocative story. Familiar yet compelling, visceral and vital, Midnight Sun is at once a response to the bizarre world we've inherited and helped to create, and a refreshing escapist daydream that, if not hopeful, is keenly insightful. The Goastt has given us a record that is poised to be a postmodern-psychedelic classic."},{"id":"4547A0B7-A9BB-41B1-A7D1-57B3370CF10C","title":"No Deal","artist":"Melanie de Biasio","description":""},{"id":"C4D500B1-03A1-469B-BF01-F2A5A5F9E328","title":"In The Army Now / Heartburn","artist":"Status Quo","description":"1986. 7\" 45rpm Single.

Record stores, but they became a band in an even more rare and special space—a California basement, dug out somewhere between the mountains and the beach. They began gigging shortly after their conception in and around Los Angeles in the later part of 2008. It wasn't until three years later that they would find the proper environment to record their first single ''Long Journey'' which now bookends their self-titled release. These were the kind of songs that bounced between London and Los Angeles, the kind of thing that could have come from Mick Jagger or Arthur Lee or both at once, with crystalline guitar and slow-mo drums that recalled the way the waves take big bites of the beach at night. This was mystery music from the strange and ancient-modern California fringe, more Night Tide than Easy Rider. Allah Las were a reflection of a reflection, an echo of an echo, a band that was psychedelic not because of reverb or shredding through pedals but for the simple way their songs seem to extend to infinity."},{"id":"E6EADC39-8838-452B-9DA4-237E99E1D9D9","title":"Womanchild","artist":"Cecile Mclorin Salvant","description":""},{"id":"40549E09-8073-44A9-BBE5-417D8305A3D8","title":"Justice","artist":"Justice","description":"JUSTICE Cross - First Album (2007 French 12-track double LP housed in a gatefold sleeve with printed inners and poster superb debut album from the French duo that sounds like Daft Punk on steroids utilising heavy processed beats schizo electronica whilst crucially still retaining elements of disco and funk.

We all know the type: prolific bands that commit every loose thought, stray idea and 90-second song fragment to tape. Bands that pay no attention to little inconveniences like \"release cycles\" or \"self-editing,\" and instead decide that quantity equals quality, creating a discography more labyrinthine, imposing and-ultimately-exhausting than the cast of creatures in a sci-fi novel. Here is why none of that applies to THEE OH SEES. Because each of the dozen-plus albums they've released since 2004 possesses a distinct personality and represents a different point along the path of JOHN DWYER's slow transformation from auteur of woozy, bare-bones four-track psychedelia to goggle-eyed garage rock marauder backed at long last by a band that both shares and stokes his singular vision. Because drop a needle on any record and-to their great credit-it takes several songs before you're convinced it's Thee Oh Sees. The seasick hundred-bottles-of-rum shanty \"What the Driven Drink,\" from 2007's delirious Sucks Blood exists in a different galaxy than the rollercoastering \"Chem-Farmer\" from last year's Carrion Crawler / The Dream; the doomy doo-wop of \"Blood on the Deck\" hardly seems like the product of the same band that delivered the yelping \"Ruby Go Home\" in 2009. And the band that made last year's engrossing Putrifiers II seems like a distant cousin to the one delivering Floating Coffin-arguably the most varied and textured Oh Sees record to date. Chalk some of the group's cunning chameleonic ability to Dwyer's fifteen-year resume. The driving force behind such beloved and sonically disparate bands as Coachwhips and Pink and Brown, Dwyer's increased fidelity to Thee Oh Sees and only Thee Oh Sees is evidence of a newfound sense of purpose and focus. Where once Dwyer used to funnel his divergent artistic ideas through a host of different channels, lately he's been finding ways to make all of those impulses function within the framework of Thee Oh Sees-who have in turn grown closer and tighter and sharper with each eye-popping, jaw-dropping live show. That sense of unity is palpable throughout Floating Coffin, the next chapter in the story of Thee Oh Sees, the one where they fix their fury against the onrushing night. It's another blistering demonstration of Thee Oh Sees greatest trick: they're the only prolific band who doesn't put out records often enough."},{"id":"30C5512F-4B79-4C56-9384-2842DED741A1","title":"Birth of the Cool","artist":"Miles Davis","description":""},{"id":"28EE4203-E0B8-4E83-A5FA-B9243B21E341","title":"Landmarks","artist":"Brian Blade & the Fellowship Band","description":""},{"id":"B26AA598-07E5-48A6-BED3-2D31BE8285D4","title":"Meddle","artist":"Pink Floyd","description":"MEDDLE 1971 HARVEST SHVL795 VINYL LP PINK FLOYD"},{"id":"C005D503-D0E7-4717-9085-3B7734E27614","title":"What Grabs Ya?","artist":"Triggerfinger","description":""},{"id":"7E51C277-1D85-49EB-A63D-EC62E6A48E85","title":"Yo","artist":"Roberto Fonseca","description":""},{"id":"05C63958-995E-4C26-8AE2-68AF5CA89053","title":"Rasputin (1978) / Vinyl single [Vinyl-Single 7'']","artist":"Boney M","description":"Boney M.
